    Accounting and valuation in the context of financial investments, such as stocks or bonds, are typically not represented by graphical charts or graphs. Instead, these concepts are more numerical and financial in nature and are usually expressed in financial statements and reports. However, there are a few financial concepts related to accounting and valuation that can be visualized through graphs:
    <ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Price Chart</h3>
        <p>
             Price charts are the most common graphical representation of the valuation of individual securities like stocks. They display the historical price movements of a security over a specified time period, usually in the form of line charts or candlestick charts. These charts help investors analyze price trends and make investment decisions.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
<h3>Line Chart</h3>
<p> This chart shows the closing prices of a security over time, allowing you to observe trends, support, and resistance levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Candlestick Chart</h3> 
<p>These charts provide more information, including open, high, low, and close prices for a specified time period, often used by technical analysts to identify patterns.</p>

</li>

<li><h3>Performance Graph</h3>
    <p>A performance graph can show the performance of an investment portfolio or a specific asset over time. It can include data such as total returns, which encompass both price changes and income generated (e.g., dividends for stocks or interest for bonds).</p>
</li>
</ul>
This graph can help investors track how their investments have grown or declined in value over time.
Portfolio Allocation Pie Chart: In the context of asset allocation, a pie chart can visually represent how a portfolio is allocated among different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, cash). Each slice of the pie represents the percentage allocated to a specific asset class.

This chart can help investors quickly grasp the diversification of their portfolio and assess whether it aligns with their investment strategy and risk tolerance.
