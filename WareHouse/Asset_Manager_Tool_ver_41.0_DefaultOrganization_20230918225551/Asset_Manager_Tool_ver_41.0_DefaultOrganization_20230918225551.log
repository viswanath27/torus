- templates: This folder should contain the HTML template files (index.html, fund_performance.html).
- static: This folder should contain the static files (css/style.css, images/statestreet_logo.png).

Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code with the actual content and implement the logic to collect the required data from Internet portals and generate the fund performance report in the `fund_performance` route.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application. In the `main.py` file, the `Flask` and `render_template` classes are used, but they are not imported. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

Once you add these import statements, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

After making this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application and the required modules. Additionally, the logic for collecting data from Internet portals and generating the fund performance report is not implemented. 

To fix these issues, you can make the following revisions:

1. Import the necessary modules in the `main.py` file:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template
   ```

2. Implement the logic for collecting data from Internet portals and generating the fund performance report in the `fund_performance` route in the `main.py` file.

3. Add appropriate comments to explain the functionality of each method and section of code.

Once you have made these revisions, the code should be ready to run and the flask application should be able to display the default nav bar options and StateStreet logo with advanced CSS styling.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application and the required modules. Additionally, the logic for collecting data from Internet portals and generating the fund performance report is not implemented. 

To fix these issues, you can make the following revisions:

1. Import the necessary modules in the `main.py` file:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template
   ```

2. Implement the logic for collecting data from Internet portals and generating the fund performance report in the `fund_performance` route in the `main.py` file.

3. Add appropriate comments to explain the functionality of each method and section of code.

Once you have made these revisions, the code should be ready to run and the flask application should be able to display the default nav bar options and StateStreet logo with advanced CSS styling."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application. Specifically, the `render_template` function is being used without importing it from the `flask` module. To fix this, you need to add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

Once you add this import statement, the code should work as expected.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

This will import the necessary `Flask` class and the `render_template` function, allowing the code to run without any errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application. Specifically, the `render_template` function is being used without importing it from the `flask` module. To fix this, you need to add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

Once you add this import statement, the code should work as expected.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

This will import the necessary `Flask` class and the `render_template` function, allowing the code to run without any errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

## Quick Install

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
