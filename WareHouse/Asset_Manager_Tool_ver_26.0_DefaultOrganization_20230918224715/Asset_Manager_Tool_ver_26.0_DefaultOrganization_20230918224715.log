As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Create the fund performance report for BajajAlliance Mutual fund. Collect the required data from Internet portals..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code looks good overall, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed. In the `main.py` file, the `data_collector` and `fund_performance_report` modules are imported, but the corresponding functions `collect_data()` and `generate_report()` are not implemented. To fix this, you need to implement these functions in the respective modules.

Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. Open the `data_collector.py` file.
2. Implement the `collect_data()` function to collect data from Internet portals and return the collected data.
3. Save the file.

4. Open the `fund_performance_report.py` file.
5. Implement the `generate_report(data)` function to generate the fund performance report using the collected data and return the generated report.
6. Save the file.

Once you have implemented these functions, the code should work as expected and generate the fund performance report based on the collected data.

Please make these changes and let me know if you need any further assistance.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `main.py` file, the `data_collector` and `fund_performance_report` modules are imported, but the corresponding functions `collect_data()` and `generate_report()` are not implemented. To fix this, you need to implement these functions in their respective modules.

Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. Open the `data_collector.py` file.
2. Implement the `collect_data()` function to collect data from Internet portals and return the collected data.
3. Save the changes.

4. Open the `fund_performance_report.py` file.
5. Implement the `generate_report(data)` function to generate the fund performance report using the collected data and return the generated report.
6. Save the changes.

Once you have implemented these functions, the code should be ready to run without any errors.

Please make the necessary changes and let me know if you need any further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `data_collector.py` file, the `collect_data()` function is returning an empty dictionary as a placeholder for the collected data. To make the application functional, you need to implement the actual code to collect data from Internet portals and populate the `data` dictionary with the collected data.

To fix this issue, you should replace the placeholder code in the `collect_data()` function with the actual code to collect data. This may involve using web scraping techniques or accessing APIs to retrieve the required data from Internet portals.

Once you have implemented the data collection code, the application should be able to generate the fund performance report correctly.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `data_collector.py` file, the `collect_data()` function is returning an empty dictionary as a placeholder for the collected data. To make the application functional, you need to implement the actual code to collect data from Internet portals and populate the `data` dictionary with the collected data.

To fix this issue, you should replace the placeholder code in the `collect_data()` function with the actual code to collect data. This may involve using web scraping techniques or accessing APIs to retrieve the required data from Internet portals.

Once you have implemented the data collection code, the application should be able to generate the fund performance report correctly.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
