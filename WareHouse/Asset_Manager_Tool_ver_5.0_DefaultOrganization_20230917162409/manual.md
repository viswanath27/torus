# Flask Application for Apple Stock Patterns

This manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the Flask application to display Apple stock data and explain its patterns. The application uses the Yfinance library in Python to read the stock data for the APPLE organization.

## Installation

To run the Flask application, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Follow the steps below to install the necessary environment dependencies:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start using the Flask application to display Apple stock data and its patterns. Follow the steps below to run the application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the Flask application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

   This will open the web application, showing the Apple stock patterns.

## Understanding the Application

The Flask application consists of two main files: `main.py` and `index.html`. Let's understand each file's purpose:

### main.py

The `main.py` file is the entry point of the Flask application. It imports the `yfinance` library, which is used to fetch the Apple stock data. You don't need to modify this file unless you want to customize the data retrieval process.

### index.html

The `index.html` file is the HTML template used to render the web page. It displays the title "Apple Stock Patterns" and a list of patterns fetched from the stock data. The patterns are dynamically generated using Flask's template engine. You can modify this file to customize the appearance of the web page.

## Customization

If you want to customize the Flask application further, you can modify the following files:

- `main.py`: You can modify the data retrieval process or add additional functionality.

- `index.html`: You can modify the HTML template to change the appearance of the web page.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run the Flask application to display Apple stock data and its patterns. You can now explore the application and customize it according to your needs. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please reach out to our support team.
