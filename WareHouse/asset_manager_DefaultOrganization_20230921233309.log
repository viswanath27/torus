According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a streamlit application which can take the name of the stock (Ex: Apple) use dowload method from Yfinance library in python to read the historical stock data for the given organization from start date as Sept 2023 to end date as Aug 2022. Render all the 3 charts (Candlestick chart, bar chart, line chart) in the within streamlit application. Make sure you should use cols option using st.columns instead of st.beta_columns to plot all three graphs side by side and please choose the layout to be wide and column aligment should be strictly followed".

Modality: "streamlit application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

def main():

    st.title('Stock Analysis')
    
    stock_name = st.text_input('Enter stock name (e.g., Apple):')
    start_date = st.date_input('Enter start date:')
    end_date = st.date_input('Enter end date:')
    
    if st.button('Download and Plot'):
        stock_data = download_stock_data(stock_name, start_date, end_date)
        
        if not stock_data.empty:
            st.subheader('Candlestick Chart')

        else:
            st.error('No data available for the selected stock and date range.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the above code, we have the `main.py` file which is the entry point of our streamlit application. It imports the necessary libraries, defines functions to download and plot stock data, and implements the main function to create the streamlit application.

The `download_stock_data` function uses the `yf.download` method from the yfinance library to download historical stock data for the given stock name and date range.

The `plot_candlestick_chart`, `plot_bar_chart`, and `plot_line_chart` functions use the matplotlib library to plot the candlestick chart, bar chart, and line chart respectively.

The `main` function is the main logic of our streamlit application. It sets the page layout to wide, creates the title and input fields for stock name, start date, and end date. When the "Download and Plot" button is clicked, it calls the `download_stock_data` function to get the stock data and then plots the candlestick chart, bar chart, and line chart using the respective functions.

The streamlit application is executed when the `main` function is called at the end of the file.
