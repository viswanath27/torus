As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Flask application. Specifically, the `render_template` function is being used without importing it from the `flask` module. 

To fix this issue, you need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

Once you add this import statement, the code should work as expected.

Create the fund performance report for BajajAlliance Mutual fund. Collect the required data from Internet portals..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code provided is missing the necessary imports for the Flask application and the required CSS styling is not implemented. Additionally, the code does not collect data from Internet portals to generate the fund performance report as mentioned in the task. 

To fix these issues, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes in the `main.py` file:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

2. Implement the missing CSS styling in the `style.css` file.

3. Collect the required data from Internet portals and generate the fund performance report in the `fund_performance` route. Replace the placeholder code with the actual implementation. For example, you can use web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or requests to fetch the data from the Internet portals. Once you have the data, you can pass it to the `fund_performance.html` template.

Once you have made these revisions, the code should be able to run without any errors and generate the fund performance report based on the collected data.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code provided is missing the necessary imports for the Flask application and the required CSS styling is not implemented. Additionally, the code does not collect data from Internet portals to generate the fund performance report as mentioned in the task. 

To fix these issues, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes in the `main.py` file:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

2. Implement the missing CSS styling in the `style.css` file.

3. Collect the required data from Internet portals and generate the fund performance report in the `fund_performance` route. Replace the placeholder code with the actual implementation. For example, you can use web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or requests to fetch the data from the Internet portals. Once you have the data, you can pass it to the `fund_performance.html` template.

Once you have made these revisions, the code should be able to run without any errors and generate the fund performance report based on the collected data."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Create the fund performance report for BajajAlliance Mutual fund. Collect the required data from Internet portals..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed.

In the `main.py` file, the `fund_performance` route is responsible for generating the fund performance report. Currently, the implementation is using placeholder data. To collect the required data from Internet portals and generate the actual report, you need to replace the placeholder code with the appropriate logic.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Identify the Internet portals from which you need to collect the data for the fund performance report.
2. Use appropriate libraries or APIs to fetch the required data from the Internet portals.
3. Process the fetched data to generate the fund performance report.
4. Replace the placeholder code in the `fund_performance` route with the actual implementation.

Make sure to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the data collection and report generation process.

Once you have implemented the above steps, the flask application will be able to generate the fund performance report using the actual data collected from the Internet portals.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed.

In the `main.py` file, the `fund_performance` route is responsible for generating the fund performance report. Currently, the implementation is using placeholder data. To collect the required data from Internet portals and generate the actual report, you need to replace the placeholder code with the appropriate logic.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Identify the Internet portals from which you need to collect the data for the fund performance report.
2. Use appropriate libraries or APIs to fetch the required data from the Internet portals.
3. Process the fetched data to generate the fund performance report.
4. Replace the placeholder code in the `fund_performance` route with the actual implementation.

Make sure to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the data collection and report generation process.

Once you have implemented the above steps, the flask application will be able to generate the fund performance report using the actual data collected from the Internet portals.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a professional flask application with default nav bar options and statestreet logo with advance css styling along with templates and static folders created in the source code. Create the fund performance report for BajajAlliance Mutual fund. Collect the required data from Internet portals..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the flask application to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file can be written based on the provided codes:

requirements.txt

```
Flask==1.1.2
```

In this case, the only dependency required for the flask application is Flask version 1.1.2. This is the package that provides the necessary functionality for building web applications using Flask.

You can add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file if your application requires additional packages. For example, if you need to collect data from Internet portals, you might need to install additional packages such as requests or BeautifulSoup. In that case, you can add those packages to the requirements.txt file as well.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
