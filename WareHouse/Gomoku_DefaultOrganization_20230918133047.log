According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a basic Gomoku game.".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

This is a basic implementation of the Gomoku game in Python using the tkinter GUI framework. The main file `main.py` sets up the GUI window and handles user interactions. The game logic is implemented in the `Game` class in the `game.py` file. The game board is represented as a 2D list, and the `is_valid_move`, `make_move`, `is_winner`, `count_in_direction`, and `reset` methods handle the game logic. The GUI is updated using the `draw_board`, `draw_piece`, `show_winner`, and `reset_game` methods in the `GomokuApp` class.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `tkinter.messagebox` module is not imported in the `main.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to display the winner message box.

To fix this, add the following line at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

This will import the `messagebox` module from `tkinter` and allow the winner message box to be displayed correctly.

After making this change, the code should be ready for execution.

To fix this, add the following line at the top of the `main.py` file:
